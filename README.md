## Getting Started

Feedly helps to bridge the gap in the services provided by NGO's by giving them a medium to serve well for the social cause and making it easier to manage their workflow.

We implemented a role based architecture for our solution. Different services are provided as per their roles respectively. The roles are divided into three sections that are Donor , NGO's and receipent . The services provided for each role respectively are as follows:-

1. Donor :- To make donations to NGO's and  giving the donor the list of things needed by NGO's at the moment to avoid unnecessary filling of storage with the non-required commodities.

2. NGO's :- To check  Donor and receipent requests and operating them accordingly. Provided a schedular  for NGO's to organize various events and camps , for example :- Education bootcamp for womens , blood donation camp,  etc. 

3. Receipent :- To request for donations by checking the available commodities in NGO's
and use services like doctor assistance,  Educational bootcamps, etc

The high level components  of our project are flutter as UI integrated  and database as firebase which are integrated using a Dart programming language.
